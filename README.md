When you pull this repo from the Rakeiora Sandpit, you should
define exactly one input for it, with the following characteristics:

- input name = Input Bam(s) (or whatever you like)
- htsget retrieval type = reads
- single/multi sample selection = multi (you're going to want to do more than one at a time)
- restrict to samples of type = normal (unless you want to run it on tumor samples)
- merge retrieved htsget regions = by sample
- file name of output = leave blank
